# Animations Hub

Animations Hub is a personal project where I experiment with UI animations using React and Motion.

The goal of this project is to understand how different kinds of user input—such as layout changes, scrolling, and pointer movement—can drive motion in interfaces. Each animation focuses on a single idea and is kept intentionally simple to make the behavior easy to understand.

## Animation Categories

Animations are grouped by what triggers them:

### Layout

Animations driven by layout changes caused by state updates, such as element reordering, position shifts, or size changes.

### Scroll

Animations whose progress is linked to scroll position, where elements scale, rotate, or transform as the user scrolls.

### Interaction

Animations that respond directly to user interaction, mainly through pointer movement, creating real-time visual feedback.

## Built With

React
Motion (motion.dev)
CSS & SVG
Vite

## Why This Project?

I built Animations Hub to:
    Learn how to use motion step by step
    Practice different types of animations that I can apply in future projects
    Keep a visual record of what I am learning

## Notes

This project is continuously evolving as I explore new animation ideas.
Each example is kept intentionally minimal to focus on the animation logic itself.
